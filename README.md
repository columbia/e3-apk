# e3-apk
Precompiled APKs for Easy Email Encryption (E3).

The E3 prototype for Android requires the use of two applications modified to support E3:

* K-9 Mail
* OpenKeychain

Please install both, then proceed through account setup in K-9 Mail as usual.

1. Install K-9 Mail and OpenKeychain from this repository.

2. Open K-9 Mail and provide your email account credentials in the account setup steps.

3. You will be asked to Allow Access to OpenKeychain - select Allow.

4. Wait while the PDK key is generated.

5. Select the newly generated PDK key.

6. (Optional) Press "Start Synchronization" to begin the process of synchronizing your E3 devices if you have other E3 mail clients.

You may access E3's settings via Settings > Account Settings > <account name> > Easy Email Encryption (E3).
